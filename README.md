# Neobanks Topic Modelling

**What is the goal of this project?**
* Gather app reviews and classify them in order to understand what are users complaining about

**Why is this even important?**
* 85% of consumers trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation
* Users are more likely to write a review if they are frustrated or having a bad experience
* App reviews will not only point out future aspects of improvement but also make users feel involved and influential
* Users are 8x more likely to download a highly rated app of an unknown brand than a poorly rated app of a known brand

**What neobanks are we analizing data about?**
* Revolut, N26, Monzo Bank and Bunq
