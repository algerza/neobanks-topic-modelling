7870,Revolut,"Awful. Revolut blocks your account (with money in it) for ""review"" and does not do anything to speed up. They only provide you with copy paste answers when you chat with them. It's outrageous and terribly frustrating. I will close the account as soon as they unlock it and I transfer my money. Thank god I was not travelling or something so I would have had all my travel money in there. Not trustful, but dissapointing.",1%,58%,40%,1%,1

14660,Revolut,"There‚Äôs no way to deposit money via credit card that works. Why it fails is very unclear from the progress/errors. And it‚Äôs unclear what exactly you pay for as a premium member, because on top of that there are also premium CARDS?

10422,N26,"Nice and useful. I would give it 5 stars if it had ways to group transactions by who sent the money, by month/ year etc. It's kind of useful if you need to sort your expenses and your incomes.",62%,14%,22%,2%,1

11254,N26,"HORRENDOUS! They take a ton of personal information in order to verify your account. However, after submitting my passport and other sensitive documents I got a generic error that something went wrong. I couldn't get help through the app since I was stuck at the error screen so I went online and used their chat. I was told the error is on their end and I would receive an email in 2-3 business days with instructions. I received an email in a few days saying they couldn't understand my address. In Ireland it's common for the address to be ""House name, Street name, City name, Post code. "" Apparently their app can't handle an address without a house/street number. No idea how to resolve that as I haven't got one. My address with the Irish postal service is a house name like ""such and such house"", no number. I tried to log in again to fully cancel my account and it's now saying I have the wrong password but not sending a password reset email as requested. Their customer service number is an automated message that hangs up on you.",0%,69%,31%,0%,1
9591,N26,"First attempt to upload pictures and video failed. I had to do everything again as retrying didn't work. Then, after my account was validated, the SMS for login never arrives. Support guy said that ""maybe"" my phone number was wrong and in any case I had to wait till I get my card to fix this problem which may take two weeks to be delivered. I makes no sense to me. Painful experience so far.",1%,33%,23%,43%,0

Try to call their 0800 number and it says sorry we can't answer the phone we are experiencing lots of phone calls. What kind of a bank can't take a phone call? Don't waste your time with this 2nd rate wannabe bank.",1%,60%,38%,1%,1

11972,MonzoBank,To restricted Cash deposit are to restrictive to be able to use this account for your main account I was hoping to turn over to monzo but after using for awhile now the 180 day deposit restriction is rediculous my work is mainly cash based and once I reach the limit which is very low I can use the account So I have no choice but to start looking at other accounts which is sad because there's a lot of features I do like I'm sure I can't be the only one not happy with this.,27%,1%,39%,33%,1

11687,MonzoBank,"Been at 1 star a while now, latest update to Monzos terms now allows you to only withdraw ¬£250 cash a month until they then charge you to withdraw your own money. Thats it for me, most money moved to another acct now, and payments into this account now also go elsewhere. If others do the same perhaps monzo will change in future...",25%,43%,1%,31%,1
15820,MonzoBank,"The app all round is fantastic however, the speed at which the balance updates is very slow. Some work needs to be undertaken on the logon process and or API latency. 

Among banking customers a balance check is the most common transaction and therefore the process should be frictionless from a CX perspective.",40%,1%,1%,58%,1
16293,bunq,"Bunq is a great bank, clearly ahead of all competition when it comes to ‚Äúdigital banks‚Äù.

3 stars go to the fact that the latest version of the app, ‚ÄúV3‚Äù, has completely ruined the overall experience. Given the branding around it, I‚Äôm not sure we will see a ‚Äúrevamp‚Äù to make it work as before anytime soon - disappointing.",97%,1%,1%,1%,1

13714,bunq,How to ruin an app 101... The best and most innovative banking app out there has just been morphed into a buggy and unintuitive marketing product. Banking features are hidden deep in the app. Instead you now see irrelevant information and instagram feeds in prominent places. I am unsure why bunq is pushing v3 on its users in such a messy state.,98%,1%,1%,1%,1
13483,bunq,My account was blocked cause i recieved 400euro's and they did'n even bother to let me know they are about to or going to freez my account like it's a good banking app but you cant just freez someones acc without letting them know first i am not happy...,1%,61%,1%,37%,1

16455,bunq,"This app is awful. Worst UX ever. 
Such a shame because the bank is super useful if based in the Netherlands however, trying to do anything is a hassle.
It‚Äôs ironic that they have a huge icon for time saved when all I seem to be doing is waiting on Bunq.....",66%,24%,1%,10%,1
16355,bunq,"Update 20-8:  cancelled both my paid personal en business accounts and switched back to ING. Bye Bunq.

I am not interested in Bunq nor your Instagram posts. Too much childish marketing bla bla. Cannot find or login to my business account after the update. It asks stupid migration or merge questions whilst dealing with payments (really?!). Took me five minutes to find out where the support button went. Gave up and tried it via the website. Did they smoke pod or what?! Time to move on to Revolut Business.",40%,19%,41%,1%,1
13676,bunq,"The new v3 update made the app a social, feelgood kind of app with a little bit of banking; the exact opposite of before. That's what I expect from a banking app as well: not having to click 21430 times to check your card setting. Quickly see the latest account events, your joint accounts or even the full names of your accounts and/or cards. The big plus on the bottom is very distracting and contains texts that feel like I'm in social media. Bunq really shoot themselves in the foot here.",93%,1%,1%,6%,1
