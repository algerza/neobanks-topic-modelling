7870,Revolut,"Awful. Revolut blocks your account (with money in it) for ""review"" and does not do anything to speed up. They only provide you with copy paste answers when you chat with them. It's outrageous and terribly frustrating. I will close the account as soon as they unlock it and I transfer my money. Thank god I was not travelling or something so I would have had all my travel money in there. Not trustful, but dissapointing.","0,009233663449","0,009281097675","0,3835607848","0,5979244541",3_customer_support,0

However, after submitting my passport and other sensitive documents I got a generic error that something went wrong. I couldn't get help through the app since I was stuck at the error screen so I went online and used their chat. I was told the error is on their end and I would receive an email in 2-3 business days with instructions. I received an email in a few days saying they couldn't understand my address. In Ireland it's common for the address to be ""House name, Street name, City name, Post code. "" Apparently their app can't handle an address without a house/street number. No idea how to resolve that as I haven't got one. My address with the Irish postal service is a house name like ""such and such house"", no number. I tried to log in again to fully cancel my account and it's now saying I have the wrong password but not sending a password reset email as requested.
